# Usage

The concept follows the flowchart:

![flowchart](../trailpack.drawio.png)

Usage is recommended via the [web-application](https://trailpack.streamlit.app/). 
For advanced users, the moficiation directly via code is accessible by installing the repository and following the steps in the [example notebook](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/trailpack/blob/main/examples/example_packing.ipynb).

A simple example on how to use the web-application is included below. First loading a data excel file and [linking the ontologies](../uploading_and_ontology_streamlit-streamlit_app-2025-10-17-08-10-31.webm)
 and adding the [general metadata](../general_metadata_to_download_streamlit-streamlit_app-2025-10-17-08-10-00.webm) towards generating the full parquet file.
