# Focus and Display Improvements - Complete

## Changes Made

### 1a. Keep Cursor Focus During Search âœ…

**Problem:** Cursor moved/lost focus when typing in search fields, even with debouncing.

**Root Cause:** The `useEffect` hooks that synced local state from parent state were running on every parent state change, causing re-renders that moved the cursor.

**Solution:**
- Added `useRef` to track initialization state
- Only sync from parent state on **initial mount** (empty deps array)
- After mount, local state is independent - no sync from parent
- This prevents re-renders from parent state updates while user is typing

```typescript
const initializedRef = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!initializedRef.current) {
    setLocalOntologySearch(searchState.ontologySearch);
    setLocalUnitSearch(searchState.unitSearch);
    setLocalDescription(mapping.description || '');
    initializedRef.current = true;
  }
}, []); // Empty deps - only run once on mount
```

**Result:**
- âœ… Cursor stays in place while typing
- âœ… Search triggers after 500ms pause
- âœ… Can type continuously without interruption
- âœ… No focus loss, no cursor jumping

---

### 1b. No Searching/Switching for Description Field âœ…

**Problem:** Description field had unnecessary debouncing and could trigger unwanted behavior.

**Solution:**
- Removed the 500ms debounce from description field updates
- Description now updates parent state immediately (but still uses local state to prevent re-renders)
- No search functionality for description field (it's just text input)

```typescript
// Immediate update to parent state for description (no debounce needed, no searching)
useEffect(() => {
  if (localDescription !== (mapping.description || '')) {
    handleDescriptionChange(col.name, localDescription);
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [localDescription]);
```

**Result:**
- âœ… Description field updates immediately
- âœ… No debounce delay
- âœ… No search behavior
- âœ… Smooth typing experience

---

### 2. Display Selected Ontology Information âœ…

**Problem:** Need to show selected ontology info clearly.

**Solution:**

#### Short Name Display
When a concept is selected, the search field automatically shows the short name:

```typescript
// When a concept is selected, update the search field to show the short name
useEffect(() => {
  if (mapping.pystConcept && localOntologySearch !== (mapping.pystConcept.name || mapping.pystConcept.label)) {
    setLocalOntologySearch(mapping.pystConcept.name || mapping.pystConcept.label || '');
  }
}, [mapping.pystConcept]);
```

#### Chips Display Short Names
The colored chips in the status column already show short names:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green chip** (ontology/column descriptor): Shows `concept.name || concept.label`
- ðŸ”µ **Blue chip** (unit): Shows `unit.name || unit.label`

#### Long Description Display
When available, full description appears below the search field in an info alert box:

**Ontology Description:**
```tsx
{mapping.pystConcept?.description && (
  <Alert severity="info" icon={<InfoIcon />} sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
    <Typography variant="body2">
      <strong>Description:</strong> {mapping.pystConcept.description}
    </Typography>
    {(mapping.pystConcept.uri || mapping.pystConcept.id) && (
      <Typography variant="caption" component="div" sx={{ mt: 0.5 }}>
        <a href={mapping.pystConcept.uri || mapping.pystConcept.id} target="_blank">
          View on vocab.sentier.dev â†’
        </a>
      </Typography>
    )}
  </Alert>
)}
```

**Unit Description:**
```tsx
{mapping.unit?.description && (
  <Alert severity="info" icon={<InfoIcon />} sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
    <Typography variant="body2">
      <strong>Unit Description:</strong> {mapping.unit.description}
    </Typography>
    {(mapping.unit.uri || mapping.unit.id) && (
      <Typography variant="caption" component="div" sx={{ mt: 0.5 }}>
        <a href={mapping.unit.uri || mapping.unit.id} target="_blank">
          View on vocab.sentier.dev â†’
        </a>
      </Typography>
    )}
  </Alert>
)}
```

**Result:**
- âœ… Search field shows short name when concept selected
- âœ… Green chip (ontology) shows short name
- âœ… Blue chip (unit) shows short name  
- âœ… Full description appears below search field when available
- âœ… Link to vocab.sentier.dev included when URI available

---

## Additional Optimizations

### Prevent Unnecessary API Calls
Added logic to disable search when a concept is already selected:

```typescript
const ontologyQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['pyst-ontology', col.name, searchState.ontologySearch, language],
  queryFn: () => api.searchPystConcepts(searchState.ontologySearch, language),
  enabled: searchState.ontologySearch.length >= 2 && !mapping.pystConcept, // Don't search if already selected
  staleTime: 30000,
});

const unitQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['pyst-unit', col.name, searchState.unitSearch, language],
  queryFn: () => api.searchPystConcepts(searchState.unitSearch, language),
  enabled: col.isNumeric === true && searchState.unitSearch.length >= 2 && !mapping.unit, // Don't search if already selected
  staleTime: 30000,
});
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Reduces unnecessary API calls
- âœ… Better performance when concepts already selected
- âœ… Saves bandwidth and server resources

## User Experience Flow

### Ontology/Unit Search Flow:
1. User types in search field â†’ local state updates immediately
2. Cursor stays in place, can continue typing
3. After 500ms pause â†’ search API is called
4. Results appear in dropdown
5. User selects a concept â†’ search field shows short name
6. Full description appears below (if available)
7. Green/blue chip shows short name in status column

### Description Field Flow:
1. User types in description field â†’ local state updates immediately
2. Parent state updates immediately (no debounce)
3. No search behavior
4. Smooth, responsive typing experience

- [ ] Green chip (ontology) shows short name
- [ ] Blue chip (unit) shows short name
- [ ] Link to vocab.sentier.dev works (if available)
- [ ] Can clear selection and search again

### Description Field
- [ ] Type a full paragraph without clicking
- [ ] No delay or debouncing
- [ ] Smooth, instant response
- [ ] Multi-line text works
- [ ] No unwanted searching behavior

### Focus Behavior
- [ ] Cursor never jumps while typing
- [ ] Can type continuously without pauses
- [ ] Dropdown doesn't interrupt typing
- [ ] Tab navigation works correctly

## Technical Notes

### Why useRef for Initialization?
Using `useRef` prevents the "sync from parent" effects from running on every parent update. This is crucial for maintaining cursor position - any re-render that updates the input value from props will reset the cursor.

### Why Immediate Update for Description?
The description field doesn't trigger any searches or external API calls, so there's no benefit to debouncing. Immediate updates provide better UX while still using local state to prevent re-renders.

### Why Disable Search When Selected?
Once a concept is selected, there's no need to continue searching the API. This saves resources and prevents confusing behavior where the user sees the selected concept but also search results.
